# ObjectStab Library

A Modelica Library for Power System Stability Studies

## Library description

The ObjectStab package is a Modelica Library for Power Systems Voltage and Transient stability simulations and presently contains the following component models:

 * Generators with constant frequency and voltage as slack or PV nodes, or using 3rd or 6th order dq-models with excitation and prime mover control systems.
 * Transmission lines in pi-link or series impedance representation.
 * Reactive power compensation devices; shunt reactors, shunt capacitances and series capacitances according to [1].
 * Fixed ratio transformers.
 * On-load tap changing transformers (OLTC) modeled as detailed discrete models or using their corresponding continuous approximations according to [2].
 * Static and dynamic loads, including induction motor according to [1] and generic exponential recovery loads according to [3].
 * Buses.
 * Faulted lines and buses including fault impedance.

Standard assumptions for multi-machine transient stability
simulations are made, i.e., generator stator and network time constants are neglected and voltages and currents are assumed to be sinusoidal and symmetrical. Except where other references are given, the components are modeled according to the guidelines given in [1].

## Current release

Download [Latest development version](../../archive/master.zip)
* updated to work with MSL 3.2.1 but still with issues:
  - [ ] fix `pre` statements outside `when`
  - [ ] fix mixture of scalar and vector values
  - [ ] fix usage of deprecated petri nets from ModelicaAdditions (use Modelica 3.3 syntax instead)
